"""Checks that every sibling site this hub links actually answers.

Run by hand: python3 admin/build/check_siblings.py

Deliberately NOT part of the pre-release gate. This site links twelve hosts it
does not control, so wiring their availability into CI would mean a sibling's
outage — or a runner with no egress — turns this repository's build red for a
reason nobody here can fix. A gate should fail for defects its own repository can
correct; everything else is a report.

So this is a report. Run it before a release, paste the result onto the comms
board with its date, and treat a 404 as information about the network rather than
as a defect in this site: a link to a correct hostname that is not yet deployed is
right and early, and removing it would make this site less useful, not more.
